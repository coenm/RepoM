# Ordering

The order of the repositories shown in RepoM is customizable. The default is alphabetical on the repository name.

Orderings are defined in yaml using repository-`comparers` and repository-`scorers` and you can switch between different orderings at any given time using the hamburger menu in RepoM.

## Comparers
