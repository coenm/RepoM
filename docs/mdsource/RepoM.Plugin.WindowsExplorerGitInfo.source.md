# Enhanced Windows Explorer Titles

As an extra goodie for Windows users, RepoM automatically detects open File Explorer windows and adds a status appendix to their title if they are in context of a git repository.

Note that for Windows 11 users, the title will not be updated but in the taskbar the additional git information is still visible.
