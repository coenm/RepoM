# WindowsExplorerTitle

As an extra goodie for Windows users, RepoM automatically detects open File Explorer windows and adds a status appendix to their title if they are in context of a git repository.

To use this module, make sure it is enabled in RepoM by opening the menu and navigate to 'Plugins'. After enabling or disabling a plugin, you should restart RepoM.
