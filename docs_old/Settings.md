# Settings

When RepoM starts for the first time, a configuration file wil be created. Most of the properties can be adjusted using the UI but, at this moment, one property must be altered manually.

To do this, make sure RepoM is not running.

## Configuration<!-- include: DocsAppSettingsTests.AppSettingsJsonFileGeneration.verified.md -->

This is the default configuration.

```json
{
  "SortKey": "",
  "SelectedQueryParser": "",
  "SelectedFilter": "",
  "AutoFetchMode": 0,
  "PruneOnFetch": false,
  "PreferredMenuSizes": {},
  "ReposRootDirectories": [],
  "Plugins": []
}
```
<!-- endInclude -->
