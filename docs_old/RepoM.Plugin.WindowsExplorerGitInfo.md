# Enhanced Windows Explorer Titles

As an extra goodie for Windows users, RepoM automatically detects open File Explorer windows and adds a status appendix to their title if they are in context of a git repository.

Note that for Windows 11 users, the title will not be updated but in the taskbar the additional git information is still visible.

To use this module, make sure it is enabled in RepoM by opening the menu and navigate to 'Plugins'. When enabling or disabling a plugin, you should restart RepoM.<!-- singleLineInclude: _plugin_enable. path: /docs/mdsource/_plugin_enable.include.md -->
